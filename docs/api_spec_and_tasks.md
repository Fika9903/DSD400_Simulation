## Required Python third-party packages

- pygame==2.0.1
- numpy==1.21.2
- scipy==1.7.1

## Required Other language third-party packages

- No third-party packages in other languages are required.

## Full API spec

No APIs are used in this project.

## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Main entry of the application. Creates instances of Organism, Environment, GameState, and UI. Contains the game loop.']
- ['organism.py', 'Defines the Organism class. Contains methods for mutation and reproduction.']
- ['environment.py', 'Defines the Environment class. Contains method for changing conditions.']
- ['game_state.py', 'Defines the GameState class. Contains methods for updating state and resetting the game.']
- ['ui.py', 'Defines the UI class. Contains methods for drawing the game and handling events.']

## Task list

- organism.py
- environment.py
- game_state.py
- ui.py
- main.py

## Shared Knowledge

The 'pygame' package is used for creating the game interface and controls. 'numpy' is used for efficient array operations and 'scipy' for scientific computations. The application is structured using an object-oriented approach.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific mechanics of the evolution and adaptation elements, such as how mutations occur and how they affect the organism's properties, are not clear. More information is needed on how the environment conditions change and how they affect the organisms.
