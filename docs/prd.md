## Original Requirements

Create a python simulation for organism evolution, similar to the game Spore.

## Product Goals

- Create an engaging and educational simulation
- Ensure the simulation is user-friendly and easy to navigate
- Incorporate elements of evolution and adaptation in the simulation

## User Stories

- As a student, I want to learn about evolution in a fun and interactive way
- As a teacher, I want to use this simulation as a teaching tool in my biology class
- As a gamer, I want a simulation that is challenging and engaging
- As a parent, I want an educational game for my child
- As a researcher, I want to use the simulation to study different evolutionary paths

## Competitive Analysis

- Spore: A popular game that allows players to guide the evolution of a species
- Evolution: A board game turned digital that focuses on adaptation and survival
- Species: A realistic evolution simulator with a focus on scientific accuracy
- Thrive: An open-source game that aims to realistically simulate the universe and evolution
- Cell to Singularity: A clicker game that takes players through the history of life on Earth

## Requirement Analysis

The product needs to be a python simulation of organism evolution. It should be user-friendly, educational, and engaging. It should incorporate elements of evolution and adaptation.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Create a user-friendly interface']
- ['P0', 'Incorporate elements of evolution and adaptation']
- ['P1', 'Make the simulation educational']
- ['P1', 'Ensure the simulation is engaging']
- ['P2', 'Include options for different evolutionary paths']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be clean and intuitive, with a main screen showing the simulation and side panels for controls and information. The design should be colorful and engaging, with clear icons and labels. The layout should be easy to navigate, with a focus on the simulation itself.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The level of complexity and realism required for the simulation is unclear. More information is needed on the target audience and their needs.
